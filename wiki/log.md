# WEALTH Wiki Log

> Append-only chronological record of wiki evolution.

## [2026-04-13] canon | Knowledge Spine forged — 11 canonical artifacts
- Created `canon/` directory with the 7 core + 4 optional canonical artifacts.
- Each core artifact follows the strict 5-section structure: Definition, Variables, Invariants, State Transitions, Failure Modes.
- Core: COSMOLOGY, GOVERNANCE, ECONOMIC_MODEL, NODE_SPEC, TELEMETRY_SCHEMA, CAPITALX_SPEC, ROADMAP.
- Optional: GLOSSARY, CASE_STUDIES, STRESS_TESTS, THREAT_MODEL.
- Added `canon/README.md` explaining the architecture and evolution rules (cap at 11).
- Created wiki page `knowledge-spine.md` and updated index.
- This is the canonical state description of the system — protocol intent preserved, framework execution enabled.

## [2026-04-13] mcp | WEALTH MCP Server packaged and validated
- Built `mcp/server.js` — stdio MCP server with 9 tools + 3 resources.
- Added `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod` to `package.json`.
- Validated server initializes and responds to MCP protocol correctly.
- Created `mcp/README.md` with integration guide (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.).
- Created wiki page `mcp-server-packaging.md` documenting the bridge to capital-aware ecosystem.
- This is the callable surface that enables Phase A: external agents querying WEALTH for real capital advantage.

## [2026-04-13] cosmology | AGI·arifOS·GEOX·WEALTH doctrine committed
- Wrote `COSMOLOGY.md` at repo root — active doctrine for the four-layer stack.
- Defined the closed-loop civilization engine and the framework→standard→protocol execution path.
- Added wiki pages: `cosmology.md`, `source-cosmology.md`.
- Updated wiki index and log.
- Emphasized Phase A non-negotiability: one working node with real capital advantage.

## [2026-04-13] build | Layer 1 Kernel + capitalx implementation
- Forged runnable Node.js 22 ESM kernel under `src/`.
- Ported canonical CJS logic from `kernel/` and `wealth/` to unified ESM.
- Implemented `src/kernel/vault999.js` — append-only immutable ledger.
- Implemented `src/kernel/capitalx.js` — risk-adjusted cost-of-capital engine.
- Created `cli.js` with commands: `boot`, `check`, `seal`, `capitalx`.
- Created `package.json` with scripts and ESM configuration.
- Added `tests/core.test.js` — 12 tests, all passing.
- Created `capitalx/DESIGN.md` and wiki pages for architecture and capitalx.

## [2026-04-13] ingest | WEALTH repository sync
- Synced VPS local `/root/WEALTH` with GitHub main (`ariffazil/WEALTH`).
- Remote was canonical; local was a partial ESM refactor.
- Merged new local files back: `STRATEGY.md`, `docs/POST_AGI_ECONOMICS_MANIFESTO.md`,
  `domain/`, `intelligence/`.

## [2026-04-13] init | LLM wiki tree forged
- Created `WIKI_AGENTS.md` schema based on Karpathy's llm-wiki pattern.
- Created `wiki/` directory with index, log, synthesis, concept, and entity pages.
- Created `raw/` directory with canonical source copies.
- Pages created: `synthesis-foundations-of-wealth`, `concept-post-agi-economics`, `concept-maruah`, `concept-thermodynamic-ethics`, `concept-888-hold`, `concept-999-seal`, `concept-12-foundations`, `concept-proxy-efficiency-test`, `concept-contextual-vitality`, `concept-cooling-prosperity`, `concept-stewardship-shift`, `entity-arifos`, `entity-wealth`, `entity-waw-federation`.

## [2026-04-13] query | "Tell me everything about foundational of wealth"
- User (arif) requested a comprehensive explanation of wealth foundations.
- Synthesized answer filed into `synthesis-foundations-of-wealth.md`.
- Cross-referenced sources: `raw/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `raw/STRATEGY.md`, `raw/TRINITY.md`, `raw/POST_AGI_ECONOMICS_MANIFESTO.md`, `raw/WAW_WEALTH_OVERVIEW.md`, and APEX canon.
